## My process

As usual went from HTML to CSS, starting with creating the container and placing elements inside (here as a column). Then mostly add to deal with the hover of the image to add the background-color and make the SVG appear in the center.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Transition

### What I learned

Add to go through hover to deal with the main image. How to use an after pseudo-element to add color to an image on hover. Also this is the first project I use REM instead of px for most of the elements. Really useful to place them directly in the :root at first to make everything neat and easy/ready to use.
